1.  What is the DOM, and why is it essential in web development with JavaScript?
The DOM is the document object model.  Back in the late 90's websites were static and relied on the user clicking links to go to an entirely different page
if they wanted to see new content.  Developers wanted a way to make pages dynamic so you could have content changes without refreshing the page.  There were
a few ways to do it but things took off with the implementation of the DOM which is a hierarchical representation of your webpage that the browser creates dynamically.  Each element
of HTML is turned into a node which allows JS can interact with, treating them as objects that can be manipulated.  




2. What is the window object in JavaScript, and how does it relate to the browser environment?
The window object represents the browser window or frame.  It's the top level of container as it comes with a vast list of properties attached to it that can you can use for a myriad of interactions on 
a web page.  You can manipulate the document, handle events, manage timers, display alerts, dialogue boxes, determine window height and width and too many other 
interactions to even begin to name but most important one for JS is the DOM.  


3.  Real-World Examples: Share 3 examples of websites or web applications that make effective use of the DOM for interactivity and user experience. Take a screenshot of the functionality and post it as part of your response.

shopping page, it's very blurry but we have all seen it before i think, there are arrows off to the side and you can click them and the 'carousel' rotates in a whole new selection of books.  you can click add to cart and all sorts of fun stuff and if you look at the url, the address never changes. 

our old friend the alert nag which i hope we never see again after this class allows you to directly interact with the window
