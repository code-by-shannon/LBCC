7.1 What does the phrase garbage in garbage out mean?
    Computers cannot tell the difference between good data and bad data. If a user provides bad data as input to a program, 
    the program will process that bad data, and as a result will produce bad data as output.

7.2 Give a general description of the input validation process.
    You should design your program in such a way that bad input is never accepted. When input is given to a program, 
    it should be inspected before it is processed. If the input is invalid, the program should discard it and prompt the user to enter the correct data.

7.3 Describe the steps that are generally taken when an input validation loop is used to validate data.
    Input is read, and then a pretest loop is executed. 
    If the input data is invalid, the body of the loop executes. 
    The loop displays an error message so that user will know that the input was invalid and then the loop reads the new input. 
    The loop is repeated as long as the input is invalid.

7.4 What is a priming read and what is its purpose?
    The first input operation just before the loop is called the priming read.
    It's purpose is to get the first input value that will be tested by the value validation loop.
    If that value is invalid, the loop will perform subsequent input operations.

7.5 if the input that is read by the priming read is valid how many times will the input validation loop iterate?
    Zero.
