1. What is the purpose of a return statement in a function?

Use a return statement to return a value.  For example returning the result of a calculation.  A value can be a number, string, boolean, object, array, null, undefined or even functions themselves.
The returned value is passed back to the caller at the time and location of where it is called and not where it is defined.  Without 'return' a function returns 'undefined' by default.

Here's an example:
*** First example without return statement: ***

function greet() {
    console.log('Hello');
}

console.log(greet());  // console shows Hello  // undefined

*** Second example WITH return statement ***
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello');
    return 'literally anything';
}

console.log(greet());  // console shows Hello  // literally anything

2. How does variable scope affect the accessibility and visibility of variables in different parts of your code?

Variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside of it.  If you need to access a variable from a function, outside of the function it needs to be declared globally, or in other words
outside of the function.

3. Write a simple function declaration, and rewrite that function as a function expression and as an arrow function.

// simple function
function musicianProfile(guitar, amp, player){
    return `${guitar}, ${amp}, ${player}`
} 

console.log(musicianProfile('Stratocaster', 'Marshall', 'Ritchie Blackmore'));

// function expression
const musicianVitals = function(guitar, amp, player){
    return `${guitar}, ${amp}, ${player}`;
} 

 console.log(musicianVitals('Stratocaster', 'Marshall', 'Ritchie Blackmore'));

 // arrow function
 const musicianVitals = (guitar, amp, player) => `${guitar}, ${amp}, ${player}`; 

 console.log(musicianVitals('Stratocaster', 'Marshall', 'Ritchie Blackmore'));
